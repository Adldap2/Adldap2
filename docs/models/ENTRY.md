## Entry Model

The entry model is a standard model that will be returned if the AD entry's object category is either not present
or is not a standard category.

Only the [standard model methods are available on the Entry model](https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/blob/master/docs/models/INDEX.md#specific-methods-available-on-all-models).
